The web server serves static content to the user or directs content that require logic or specific content to the application server
The application server is used to perform several logical tasks and usually connects with the database to update or fetch data. It also generates dynamic content

SPOF:There is only one server and if something happens to it, the website is down.
Also, during maintenance, there is certainly going to be downtime as there is no other server
Whenever the load on the sever reaches its capacit, it cannot scale and therefore, the server might crash or the website may behave unexpectedly or slowly.
