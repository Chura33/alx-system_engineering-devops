Firewalls (1 for each server and one for the load balancer): Firewalls add a layer of security, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent unauthorized access and potential threats.
SSL certificate helps to encrypt data between the user and server
Monitoring clients help to collect data from servers such as performance, temperature error logs
Firewalls are for restricting the kind of data that is allowed in the infrastructure
The traffic is served over https to ensure privacy between the user and server so that anyone who intercepts the data will not be able to decrypt
Monitoring is used to check the performance of our infrastructure
Monitoring devices collect data from various sources like cpu usage, network traffic etc.
To monitor queries per second, I would configure  monitoring tools to track the number of incoming requests per unit of time, such as requests per minute or per second


ISSUES
1. Terminating ssl in load balancer is an issue because decrypted data enters the server and this could be dangerously used if the server is hacked or even by malicious staff.
2. Only one sql server for accepting writes  is SPOF because if down, users would not be able to make post requests to the database.
3. Having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) can lead to potential issues in terms of redundancy, scalability, and resilience.
